# ESP32-SDCard-WiFi-Logger
A simple data logger using **ESP32** and **Micro SD card adapter** that logs data to a CSV file and hosts a **WiFi web server** to view or download the file directly from a browser.

## Features
- Logs sensor or random data into `data.csv` on SD card.
- Hosts a **web server** on ESP32 to access logged data.
- Provides a **Download button** for saving the CSV to your laptop or phone.
- Supports **static IP configuration** for easy access.
- Responsive web page design (works on mobile and desktop).

## Hardware Required
- ESP32 Development Board
- Micro SD card module (SPI mode)
- Micro SD card (formatted FAT32)
- Jumper wires
